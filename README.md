# Auth of the one of my projects

This project was a cloud-based and mobile-friendly platform that allows distributors and customers to manage gas devices, see the status of devices and the status of customer's gas usage in real-time. 

I this project I used:
1) Ngrx (Redux)
2) Angular Material
3) AWS SDK and Amazon Cognito Identity SDK for JavaScript
4) Sentry
5) Inline Manual
6) Google Charts
7) WebSockets

Also, I used FlexBox for responsive templates.

This example of the Auth process includes:
1) components with templates, styles and controllers
2) Reducer, Actions, Selectors and Side-Effects
3) Services for Auth with AWS Cognito
4) Routes for Auth
